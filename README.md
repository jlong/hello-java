# Hello

Canonical hello world program in Java.

# Building

You will need to have Maven installed. I recommend installing with HomeBrew..

To build the jar file with Maven, run:

    mvn package

This will create `hello-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar` in the `target/` directory.

# Tests

To run tests, use Maven:

    mvn test

Tests are written in JUnit.
